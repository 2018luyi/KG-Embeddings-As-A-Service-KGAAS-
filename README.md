# KG-Embeddings-As-A-Service-KGAAS-
This project was started at the BioHackthon19. 
# Aim
Make knowledge graph widely available as a service
# Motivation 
KG embeddings methods are available as standalone packages with specific hardware and software requirements
Tricky hyper-parameters settings for non-expert users
# Main Tasks (work under progress): 
* Create an automated backend pipeline to run the input graph  (in RDF) with the selected KG model. User may input specific entities/link to be predicted
## Functionalities:
* Process the graph in a format that makes easy for the embedding method to use
* Combine around 13 models for model training and prediction
* Run the selected model
* Generate and send embeddings to user
* Predict and output entities/links with respect to selected model 

* Create a frontend interface to allow the user to upload, select the model with some brief comments/guidelines about the most essential hyper-parameters for each model
      
## Create a dockerized version
